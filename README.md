# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

THe projects uses FreeGamesApi for Games Fetching and Search with implementation of Firebase for login and signup as well as full stimulation of Transaction with OTP verification using Twilo SMS.

Front-end- npm run dev
Back-end- cd .\server.\ + node server.js

Requires Api + Auth token for firebase & Twilio
